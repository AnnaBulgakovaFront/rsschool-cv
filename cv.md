**About me:**
I am actively learning front-end development. I know html and css, I can create adaptive layouts. I know js at the level: add classes, calculate the screen height, work with arrays and their methods. In the future I want to learn vue or react. I made layouts using the gulp build system.

**Skills**
* HTML
* CSS
* JS (basic skills)
* BEM

**Ð¡ode examples**
```JavaScript
function likes(names) {
  if (Array.isArray(names)) {
    let usersLikes = names.length;
    switch (usersLikes) {
      case 0: 
        return 'no one likes this'
      case 1: 
        return `${names[0]} likes this`
        break;
      case 2: 
        return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`
        break;
      case 3: 
        return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`
        break;
      default:
          return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${usersLikes - 2} others like this`
    }
  }
  return 'no one likes this'
}
